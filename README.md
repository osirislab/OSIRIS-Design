# OSIRIS Design Resources & Guidelines
This repository currently contains the logo, flyers, and a few other miscellaneous branding items for the NYU OSIRIS Lab. 

## Colours
We use the [NYU official colours](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/nyu-brand-guidelines/designing-in-our-style/nyu-colors.html), in particular NYU Violent (#57068c) and Teal (#009b8a). 

## Font
Our main font is [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/), in particular the quasi-proportional variant Iosevka Aile. We don't use any stylistic sets.

[Galmuri](https://quiple.dev/galmuri) can be used for a stylised, secondary font. For example, header text on our site is in Galmuri.

If using these fonts for the web, make sure to use font subsetting - they both contain large character sets, including CJK, so the source font files are quite big!
