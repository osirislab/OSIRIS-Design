# OSIRIS Design Resources & Guidelines
This repository currently contains the logo, flyers, and a few other miscellaneous branding items for the NYU OSIRIS Lab. 

## Colours
We use the [NYU official colours](https://www.nyu.edu/employees/resources-and-services/media-and-communications/nyu-brand-guidelines/designing-in-our-style/nyu-colors.html), in particular NYU Violent (#57068c) and Teal (#009b8a). 

## Font
The font we use for OSIRIS design is Iosevka Aile (Aile is the quasi-proportional variant, do not select any stylistic sets).
